# PomodoroApp
## About The Project
Pomodoro App is a web design project, which helped me develop my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I passed my final exams at university very quickly so I had an extra time to try new technologies and I decided that I would create a simple app that will help me to manage my time. I got basic knowledge about JS and in the next semester I will expand it, because I'm having subjects about JavaScript, web development and web designing. In the future I want to constantly extend this project, because I have many ideas how to improve its functionalities.<br/>[Here you can check the result of my work](https://pawelpabianczyk.github.io/PomodoroApp/).
